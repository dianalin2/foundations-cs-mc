A small game demo for TJHSST's Foundations of Computer Science course during the Summer 2022 session.

## How to Play

* `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move.
* `Q` to show debug info.
* `L` to save the map.
* Right click to place a block.
* Left click to destroy a block.
* Scroll or use home row to change inventory slot.
* `M` to mute/unmute music.

## Known Bugs

* Sometimes block selection doesn't work properly.
* Bounding boxes for crafting don't properly detect the edges properly.

## Additional Notes

* Lots of this code is extremely messy; in the future, I hope to clean it up and improve code clarity.
